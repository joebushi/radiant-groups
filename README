== Groups

1. Dashboard
This part shows informations on you application like number of users,
number of groups, last modified pages, etc...
By default when you log in the admin you are redirected to the dashboard.

2. Groups and Menus
This part allow admins to create groups, link users to groups and manage
access to every extensions.
Admins will be able to build menu tabs (with submenus) in the admin back-end.
By default 3 groups are created : Developer, Admin and User.
Each user has only one group. The default group is configured in the settings,
at first the default group is "User" (which has no backend access).
When you remove a user from a group this user will be automatically assigned
to the default group.
Admin can also enable/disable users.


== Requirements

Radiant CMS 0.7.1


== How it works ?

Groups extension is keeping the current way of restricting backend access,
example :
  $ only_allow_access_to :index, :new, :edit, :remove, (write your own views)
  $   :when => :admin,
  $   :denied_url => {:controller => 'dashboard', :action => :index},
  $   :denied_message => 'You must have administrative privileges to perform this action.'
But a part of the authorization process has been overwrite. 'Developer' and 'Admin'
are not used any more, the equivalent is present in 'Groups' and 'Menus' menus.
The Radiant core doesn't need to be updated, but be careful to update the
controllers from external extensions with the code present above.


== Why using Groups extension ?

In some projects you need more than two groups (Admin and Developer by default)
which have backend restricted access.
'Administrators' group need a full access, 'commercials' group need to access
to some extension, the 'designs' groups need only access to 'snippets' and
'layouts' etc... Groups extension allow you to manage users access to extensions
according to their groups.
